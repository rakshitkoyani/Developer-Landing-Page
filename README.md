## What I have learnt in this project

- I learn lots of things by building this one page website. Also improved my flexbox concepts. I solve the issue in blog section by reanalyzing the code and apply flex with position.
- Also learn how to put slider button after the flex section.

## Honest Time to finish the project

It took me around 7 hours to complete me this project.
